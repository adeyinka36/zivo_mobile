# New Payment Flow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation changes the payment flow to ensure media is only uploaded after successful payment completion. This provides better security, user experience, and resource management.

## Architecture Changes

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Form State Management
- **File**: `services/formStateService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Manages form state persistence and validation
- **Features**:
  - Auto-save form state to AsyncStorage
  - Form validation
  - State recovery on app restart
  - Clear state after successful upload

#### 2. Updated Payment Service
- **File**: `services/paymentService.ts`
- **New Methods**:
  - `createPaymentIntent(metadata)`: Creates payment intent with metadata only
  - `uploadAfterPayment(request)`: Uploads media after successful payment

#### 3. Updated Create Screen
- **File**: `app/(app)/create.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Uses form state management
  - Creates payment intent with metadata only
  - No file upload during payment creation

#### 4. Updated Payment Screen
- **File**: `app/(app)/payment.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Handles post-payment upload
  - Shows upload progress
  - Clears form state after success
  - Provides retry mechanism for failed uploads

### Backend Changes

#### 1. New Media Controller Methods
- **File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Api/MediaController.php`
- **New Methods**:
  - `createPaymentIntent()`: Creates payment intent with metadata only
  - `uploadAfterPayment()`: Handles file upload after successful payment

#### 2. Updated Routes
- **File**: `routes/api.php`
- **New Routes**:
  - `POST /media/payment-intent`: Create payment intent
  - `POST /media/upload-after-payment`: Upload after payment

#### 3. Cleanup Command
- **File**: `app/Console/Commands/CleanupAbandonedPayments.php`
- **Purpose**: Cleans up abandoned payments and media records

## Flow Diagram

```
1. User fills form → Form state saved to AsyncStorage
2. User clicks "Proceed to Payment" → Validation → Create payment intent (metadata only)
3. User completes payment → Stripe webhook → Payment confirmed
4. Frontend polls payment status → Payment succeeded
5. Frontend uploads media → Backend processes upload
6. Form state cleared → User redirected to home
```

## Key Benefits

### 1. Security
- No media uploaded without payment
- Payment verification before upload
- Proper ownership validation

### 2. User Experience
- Faster payment flow (no file upload during payment)
- Form state persistence (survives app crashes)
- Clear progress indicators
- Retry mechanisms for failed uploads

### 3. Resource Management
- No server storage for incomplete uploads
- Automatic cleanup of abandoned payments
- Efficient database usage

### 4. Reliability
- Idempotent operations
- Proper error handling
- State recovery mechanisms

## Error Handling

### 1. Payment Success, Upload Failure
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- User notification of upload status
- Manual retry option

### 2. App Crash/State Loss
- Auto-save to AsyncStorage
- Recovery screen on app restart
- Option to recreate form

### 3. Network Issues
- Queue upload for when online
- Show offline status
- Resume when connection restored

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Payment success rate
- Upload success rate after payment
- Average upload time
- State loss frequency

### Alerts
- Failed uploads after successful payments
- High abandonment rates
- Payment success without upload

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Complete payment → Successful upload
2. **Payment Failure**: Payment fails → No upload
3. **Upload Failure**: Payment succeeds → Upload fails → Retry
4. **App Crash**: App crashes during payment → State recovery
5. **Network Issues**: Poor connection → Upload retry

### Test Data
- Use Stripe test cards
- Test with various file sizes
- Test with different network conditions

## Deployment Notes

### 1. Database Migration
- No new migrations required
- Existing payment and media tables work

### 2. Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- Existing Stripe configuration works

### 3. Scheduled Tasks
- Add cleanup command to cron:
```bash
# Clean up abandoned payments every hour
0 * * * * php artisan payments:cleanup-abandoned --hours=24
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the system can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting to the old `store()` method in MediaController
2. Updating frontend to use the old flow
3. Cleaning up any pending payments

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Support**: Queue uploads for when online
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress
3. **Batch Uploads**: Support for multiple files
4. **Advanced Retry**: More sophisticated retry logic
5. **Analytics**: Detailed payment and upload analytics
